Shared Dependencies:

- Environment Variables:
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY` (exported from `.env` and used in `summary_generator.py`)

- Python Libraries:
  - `pathlib` (used in `directory_scanner.py`)
  - `os` (used in `summary_generator.py`)
  - `requests` (used in `summary_generator.py` and listed in `requirements.txt`)
  - `python-dotenv` (used to load environment variables in main application script, listed in `requirements.txt`)
  - `tqdm` (used for progress tracking in main application script, listed in `requirements.txt`)
  - `argparse` (used in `analyze.py`)

- Function Names:
  - `scan_directory` (defined in `directory_scanner.py` and called in `analyze.py`)
  - `read_and_chunk_file` (defined in `file_analyzer.py` and called in main application logic)
  - `generate_summary` (defined in `summary_generator.py` and called in main application logic)
  - `main` (defined in `analyze.py` as the entry point of the application)

- Data Structures:
  - `summaries_cache` (a dictionary used for in-memory caching, likely to be used in main application logic)

- File Names:
  - `requirements.txt` (used for dependency installation)
  - `.env` (used for storing sensitive environment variables)
  - `example.env` (template for `.env` file)
  - `directory_scanner.py` (module for directory traversal)
  - `file_analyzer.py` (module for file reading and chunking)
  - `summary_generator.py` (module for generating summaries with OpenAI API)
  - `analyze.py` (main script for user interface and application logic)
  - `README.md` (for documentation and user guide)

Please note that the actual implementation may require additional shared dependencies or modifications to these names based on the specific design and requirements of the application.
